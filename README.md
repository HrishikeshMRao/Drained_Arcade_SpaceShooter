# Drained_Arcade_SpaceShooter
Access the .exe file within the build files to launch the game. Clone this repository in your local machine. using git clone.

There is a Vedio attached aswell just for a better insight into my work please check it. I would have attached it in the README only if the file size wasnt large. This has a better frameRate compared to the Maze-Juper video clip. Sorry for the inconvienience.

Thankyou for visiting.
